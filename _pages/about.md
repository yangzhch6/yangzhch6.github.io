About me
===
<!-- I obtained my Master's degree at the [HCP Lab](http://www.sysu-hcp.net/home/) and bachelor's degree in SYSU, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voxznZAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) to conduct research in NLP. -->


<!-- Research Interests
=== -->
Bro is currently pursuing a PhD degree with a keen focus on Reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). 
Specifically, I focus on the followings:
* Solve & Verify
* Reasoning Data Synthesis
* Test-Time Scaling


> If you’re interested in collaborating or exploring potential research opportunities, please don’t hesitate to reach out (带带哥们).
