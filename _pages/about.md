Short Bio
===
<!-- I obtained my Master's degree at the [HCP Lab](http://www.sysu-hcp.net/home/) and bachelor's degree in SYSU, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voxznZAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) to conduct research in NLP. -->


<!-- Research Interests
=== -->
I’m Zhicheng YANG, currently pursuing a PhD with a keen focus on Reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). 
<!-- Under the guidance and collaboration of esteemed advisors: [Xiaodan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voxznZAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), [Zhijiang Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8b-u3icAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), and [Jing Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=0S4cpyoAAAAJ).  -->
I focus on the following topics:
* Automatic Data Synthesis
* Long Chain Reasoning
* Self-Evolution Framework
* Learning Efficiency (performance improvement / data usage)
  
> If you’re interested in collaborating or exploring potential research opportunities, please don’t hesitate to reach out (带带哥们).
